                <!---- h2>Definition of Autocross</h2 -->
                <p>Autocross is a form of motorsport where a course is laid out with traffic cones in a big paved surface. Drivers navigate through the course one at a time and attempt to drive through the course as fast as possible, without hitting any
                    of the course marker cones, and to go through the series of cones in the manner that is mandated by the event organizer. Hitting a marker cone usually results in a two second time penalty per cone that is added to the driver's total
                    time for a given run. Not going through the series of cones as mandated by the organizers results in a "Did Not Finish (DNF) " or simply the time incurred for that run is not going to be conisdered for calcuations of awards and trophies
                    at the end of the event.</p>
                <p>This form of motorsport aims to challenge a driver's ability in controlling his or her car through the course, and is focused more on car control as oppose to outright speed and car engine power. Autocross allows a driver to hone and master
                    car control skills that can translate to other forms of timed motorsports competition. It is a legitimate way to explore and improve your driving capabilities. It is often noted that autocross is the gateway to other more involved
                    forms of timed motorsports. But the real best part about participating in autocross are the people that you meet in the sport. For the most part, these people are car enthusiasts that just likes to have fun with their car in a legal
                    way. And these people are also some of the nicest people you will ever meet.

                <p>Every vehicle that will go into the course MUST pass a technical inspection for safety and course worthiness.</p>
                <h2>Is Autocross Legal</h2>
                <p>A properly sanctioned autocross event is legal in regards to the violation of common traffic laws. The events are held in controlled environments that mitigates the risks to the participants and their vehicles. Along with this safety protocols
                    are in place during the event. The New York Region SCCA follows the mandates set forth by the Sports Car Club of America for safely holding an autocross event.
                </p>
                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>Safety protocols are in place in accordance with the guidelines set forth by the Sports Car Club of America. As a new participant, it is recommended that at minimum you attend the driver's meeting and participate in at least 1 novice walk.
                    Safety protocols are reviewed at the driver's meeting and the novice walk is an opportunity for a beginner to learn the basics of navigating through an autocross course. When driving on course, pay attention to red flags being waved
                    on course. When you see a red flag being waved, come to a controlled full stop. you will be given a re run if there is an emergent situation on course while you where taking a run.

                <h2>Work and Drive Groups</h2>
                <p>Working an event is part of participating in an autocross. Every single participant is given a specifc work assignment before, during and after the event. The autocross organizers of the event do the work on a voluntary basis based on
                    their love for cars and performance driving. The entry fee that a participant pays goes towards the rental of the autocross site, maintenance and procurement of club equipment required to hold an autocross event, and administrative
                    costs related to holding an event. Competitor participation in the event is one of the key factos that keeps the cost of autocross participation very low in comparison with other forms of timed sanctioned motorsports events. Work assignments
                    and run group assignments are announced at the driver's meeting before the event starts. Essentially for the day, you're either "driving" or "working".
                </p>
                <h3>Common Work Assignments</h3>
                <li>Station work : setting up knocked down cones, calling in penalties to timing and scoring, and flagging
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grid: Preparing drivers to take their runs, lining them up to the start, marking the run sticker.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Timing and scoring: Managing the timing software, keeping track of driver penalties, communicating to grid which driver gets a re run.
